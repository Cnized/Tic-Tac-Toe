# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Command-Line Version)

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built in Python.  
This version runs in the **terminal/command line**, allowing two players to play against each other interactively.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Two-player interactive mode.
- Input validation (no overwriting moves, no invalid cells).
- Detects **wins, draws**, and handles **index errors** gracefully.
- **Play again option** after a game finishes.
- Clean and minimal design, runs entirely in the terminal.

## 🎯 Usage
- The board uses numbers **1–9** to represent positions:

```
 1 | 2 | 3

 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9
```

- Players take turns entering a number between **1–9**.
- The game announces the winner or a draw.
- After each game, players can choose to **play again** or **quit**.
